# Custom python scripts

## Card randomizer for the board game Dice Forge
Creates an image of the main board and adds random cards in each of the spaces for the board game Dice Forge.

## Cartoons watcher
A small python script that uses Selenium to open a website with cartoons in Chromium and play them.
The website didn't have option to automatically start the next episode.
Need to rework this one.

## Joystic to mouse
Very basic script that allows moving the mouse with the joystick left thumb button.
Needs pygame and mouse modules.
